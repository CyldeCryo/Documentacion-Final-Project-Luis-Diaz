	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>  the main conclusion that i drew was that in mostly how meticulus and how many moving parts there existed in creating such a network as there are many moving parts that if everything works they each work in tandem to create the popose they were designed for which just makes me think in how many moving parts there are in such big networks that can span around entire companies. one thing that i did learn in this project was how to corectly identify problems/erros as one of the erros i identified was not actually one error but 2 that made it look like one which is why i learned to use the sim mode to see where packeges go so i can corretly identify the problem.  </p>
